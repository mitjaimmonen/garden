This document contains ideas that I have had over time, such as company ideas, new apps, games.

Generally each idea has a basic info table about what it is and a description/overview.

| Platform | Shop for e-ink devices |

### Overview

Sell tablets and phones with e-ink and traditional features, physical keyboards and note taking devices.

In Finland there are not any specialized resellers for this stuff and it is a healthy technology. Maybe the store could sell all kinds of privacy friendly, user friendly and healthy tech that improves one's life in a different way from the usual.

## Cell Sim Clonk

| ---------- | ----------- |

### Overview

**Idea:**
- Mining & building similar to Clonk
- AI to navigate home from a mine
- Control multiple characters, possibly
- Grid Cell / Pixel  physics simulation, simplified Noita
- Dynamic tilemapping, meaning the art updates with seamless cell styling along with the cells / “pixels” updating every frame
- Automatic collider generation, cells turn into slopes, so if there are dynamic objects thrown at a wall, it does not detect the normals as 4-directional, but more like splines

| Type      | App / Game  |
| Platform  | Mobile      |
| Framework | Game Engine |
### Overview

Currently Mobile App Stores are filled to the brink with shitty corporate apps, which are just ads and consumerism. People should get out of this fake world and go outside where no billboards reach them. Nowadays people are lazy, get bored and have no attention span for non-gamified things that do not cause instant gratification. This app/game tries to make the best of it.

A tracker app which tracks how much you spend time outside, in national parks, walking, jogging etc.

Tracked distances and times become some sort of in-game resource.

Build a game around that…



# Snack tracker

Weekly or monthly allowance app.



# USB Hub

Build a USB hub that actually works. The hub would support 2 screens, power pass-through and more. Additional usb-c slots too.
