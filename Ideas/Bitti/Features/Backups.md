## Backups

**Firebase Firestore:**
- The easiest solution
- Dangerous as data can be misused 
	- needs cloud functions to stop costs
	- Possibly needs to be hosted by an ltd company to mitigate risk
- Multiple sign in options
- Secure and safe

**Self hosted:**
- A lot more difficult setup
- Security must be foolproof - difficult, ltd again might be needed to mitigate risk

**Supabase:**
- Open source alternative to firebase
- Cost control - no risk of unplanned costs
