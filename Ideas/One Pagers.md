(MVP) Mini journal - Fill one thing per day
Extensive journal, multiple entries & some measurements/sliders about daily mood. Overview stats for the daily measurements - avoid short-term graphs
Allow editing up to yesterday

Yearly theme comes from this idea: [https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE)

**Daily notes**
- Gratitude journaling
- Easy way to browse daily note history, google calendar agenda style

**A page / notebook layout, instead of endless scrollview**

## Outside

| Key       | Value       |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Type      | App / Game  |
| Platform  | Mobile      |
| Framework | Game Engine |
### Overview

Currently Mobile App Stores are filled to the brink with shitty corporate apps, which are just ads and consumerism. People should get out of this fake world and go outside where no billboards reach them. Nowadays people are lazy, get bored and have no attention span for non-gamified things that do not cause instant gratification. This app/game tries to make the best of it.

A tracker app which tracks how much you spend time outside, in national parks, walking, jogging etc.

Tracked distances and times become some sort of in-game resource.

Build a game around that…
